It adds even\n            more to the task when multiple people have sent these requests, and\n            all a manager wishes to do is approve them at once.\n          </p>\n\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Definition</h3>\n          <p>\n            Our PM team defined 3 use cases for us to address from the Home\n            page:\n            <ol>\n              <li>\n                <em>Toggle View</em> - Ability to toggle between detail view and\n                overview.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <em>Grouping</em> – Ability to view different categories from\n                within a group.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <em>Bulk Action</em> – Ability to take action on multiple items\n                at once.\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n          </p>\n\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Explorations</h3>\n          <p>\n            Extensive user research had already been done by the team to\n            understand the user.
