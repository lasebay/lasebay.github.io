Its guidelines provide resources and tools\n            to design conversational products for business applications.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The guidelines contained a lot of information that, at first glance,\n            may seem overwhelming for someone who is interested in creating\n            conversational experiences for enterprise. I took on the task to\n            update and streamline the contents of the guidelines and present\n            them in a way that can be easily found and understood.\n          </p>\n\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Background Research</h3>\n          <p>\n            I kicked off the project by looking at existing conversational UX\n            guidelines, both internal and external, to get a sense of key topics\n            presented in various existing conversational products. I compared\n            the guidelines for consumer-facing and enterprise-facing products\n            and drew similarities in how different guideline sites organized\n            their information to enable digestibility of information.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I also gathered inspiration from various digital assistants in\n            today’s market—both consumer- and enterprise-facing—and how they\n            communicate their standards and guidelines.\n          </p>\n\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 className=\"major\">User Research</h3>\n          <p>\n            After gathering background knowledge in conversation design, I\n            proceeded to conduct card sorting and hierarchy studies to\n            understand how our audience understands the information we currently\n            have and what they expect to take away from our improved guidelines.\n          </p>\n\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Design</h3>\n          <p>\n            After the hierarchy studies, I brainstormed with my team an improved\n            sitemap hierarchy with topics that were directly informed by the\n            research results and organized in a way that our audience can easily\n            navigate. It included some old and some new topics.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The rest of the work was to update existing topics that we aimed to\n            keep in the improved site, create new ones based on the research\n            results, and merge any redundant pieces together to streamline the\n            overall guidelines.\n          </p>\n\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Assessment</h3>\n          <p>\n            This project needs to go through more validation with our audience.\n            So, the next steps are to share the site articles internally and\n            gather feedback on content and overall digestibility from people in\n            various roles within conversation design—designers, product\n            managers, developers, UA, etc. The goal is to assess whether the\n            revised topics contain content that our audiences can find and\n            absorb easily in order to better create conversational\n            experiences—no more, no less.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
